DOCKER PROJECT:


yum install docker -y
systemctl start docker
systemctl status docker

FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update -y
RUN apt-get install apache2 -y
COPY index.html /var/www/html/
CMD ["/usr/sbin/apachectl", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]



DOCKER FILE	: To create image by automation.
DOCKER COMPOSE	: To create multiple containers on single server.
DOCKER SWARM	: To create multiple containers on Multiple server.
DOCKE STACK	: Docker swarm + Docker compose

1. CREATE 3 SERVERS AND INSTALL DOCKER ON ALL OF THEM & CREATE CLUSTER OF IT

yum install docker -y
systemctl start docker
systemctl status docker
docker swarm init --advertise-addr 172.31.85.110
docker node ls


2. INSTALLING JENKINS (MASTER)

#STEP-1: INSTALLING GIT JAVA-1.8.0 MAVEN 
yum install git java-1.8.0-openjdk maven -y

#STEP-2: GETTING THE REPO (jenkins.io --> download -- > redhat)
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key

#STEP-3: DOWNLOAD JAVA11 AND JENKINS
amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y
yum install jenkins -y
update-alternatives --config java

#STEP-4: RESTARTING JENKINS (when we download service it will on stopped state)
systemctl start jenkins.service
systemctl status jenkins.service


3. CREATE CUSTOM IMAGES AND PUSH TO DOCKERHUB WITH TAGS

DOCKER FILE:
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update -y
RUN apt-get install apache2 -y
COPY index.html /var/www/html/
CMD ["/usr/sbin/apachectl", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]

INDEX.HTML:


PIPELINE:

pipeline {
    agent any 
    
    stages {
        stage('checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/RAHAMSHAIK007/dockernewproject.git'
            }
        }
        stage('build') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t $img .'
            }
        }
        stage('tag') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker tag $img $repo'
            }
        }
        stage('push') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker login -u  -p '
                sh 'docker push $repo'
            }
        }
    }
}


4. GIVE PERMISSIONS

chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart docker.service


5. WRITE COMPOSE FILE AND PUSH TO GITHUB

version: '3'
services:
  devops:
    image: rahamshaik/devopsreponit:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - "devopsvol"
    deploy:
      replicas: 3

  aws:
    image: rahamshaik/awsreponit:latest
    ports:
      - "81:80"
    volumes:
      - "awsvol"
    deploy:
      replicas: 3

  datascience:
    image: rahamshaik/datasciencereponit:latest
    ports:
      - "82:80"
    volumes:
      - "datasciencevol"
    deploy:
      replicas: 3

  azure:
    image: rahamshaik/azurereponit:latest
    ports:
      - "83:80"
    volumes:
      - "azurevol"
    deploy:
      replicas: 3

DOCKER STACK:
Docker stack is used to create multiple services on multiple hosts. i.e it will create multiple containers on multile servers with the help of compose file.
To use the docker stack we have initialized docker swarm, if we are not using docker swarm, docker stack will not work.
once we remove the stack automatically all the containers will gets deleted.
We can share the containers from manager to worker according to the replicas
Ex: Lets assume if we have 2 servers which is manager and worker, if we deployed a stack with 4 replicas. 2 are present in manager and 2 are present in worker.
Here manager will divide the work based on the load on a server

COMMAND:
TO DEPLOY : docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml stack_name
TO LIST : docker stack ls
TO GET CONTAINERS OF A STACK : docker stack ps stack_name
TO GET SERVICES OF A STACK: docker stack services stack_name
TO DELETE A STACK: docker stack rm stack_name


PORTAINER:
it is a container organizer, designed to make tasks easier, whether they are clustered or not. 
abel to connect multiple clusters, access the containers, migrate stacks between clusters
it is not a testing environment mainly used for production routines in large companies.
Portainer consists of two elements, the Portainer Server and the Portainer Agent. 
Both elements run as lightweight Docker containers on a Docker engine

SETUP:
Must have swarm mode and all ports enable with docker engine
curl -L https://downloads.portainer.io/ce2-16/portainer-agent-stack.yml -o portainer-agent-stack.yml
docker stack deploy -c portainer-agent-stack.yml portainer
 docker ps
public-ip of swamr master:9000
